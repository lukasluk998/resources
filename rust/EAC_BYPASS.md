# EAC Bypass Guide - 2026

This cheat uses multiple layers to bypass Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) in Rust.

## How EAC Works

### Detection Layers

1. **Kernel Driver** (`EasyAntiCheat.sys`)
   - Runs at ring-0 (kernel mode)
   - Monitors all process memory operations
   - Enumerates loaded drivers and modules
   - Scans for known cheat signatures
   - Reports back to EAC servers

2. **User-Mode DLL** (`EasyAntiCheat.dll`)
   - Hooks WinAPI functions
   - Detects process injection
   - Validates game code integrity
   - Screenshots periodically

3. **Server-Side Analysis**
   - Statistics-based detection (impossible accuracy)
   - Behavioral patterns (snap aiming, perfect recoil)
   - Reports from other players
   - HWID tracking and bans

## Our Bypass Techniques

### 1. Kernel Driver (`driver/driver.c`)

**Why:** Bypasses user-mode ReadProcessMemory/WriteProcessMemory hooks.

**How:**
- Our driver runs at kernel level (same as EAC)
- Uses `KeStackAttachProcess` to read/write memory
- Unlinks itself from `PsLoadedModuleList` (invisible to enumeration)
- Custom IOCTL communication (not standard WinAPI)

**Code:**
```c
// Attach to game process at kernel level
KeStackAttachProcess(process, &apcState);
RtlCopyMemory(Buffer, Address, Size);  // Direct memory access
KeUnstackDetachProcess(&apcState);
```

**Detection Risk:** Medium
- Requires driver signing
- Can be blacklisted by signature
- Use polymorphic builds

### 2. Delayed Initialization

**Why:** EAC scans heavily during game startup (first 30-60 seconds).

**How:**
```rust
EACBypass::wait_for_game_load();  // Wait 30s
```

Start cheating after the initial scan completes.

**Detection Risk:** Low

### 3. Random Delays

**Why:** EAC detects rapid, repeated memory operations.

**How:**
```rust
EACBypass::random_delay();  // 50-150ms random jitter
```

Each read/write has variable timing to avoid pattern detection.

**Detection Risk:** Low

### 4. Memory Protection Checks

**Why:** EAC monitors which processes call `ReadProcessMemory`.

**How:**
```rust
// Check if memory is readable before accessing
VirtualQueryEx(process, address, &info, size);
```

Verify memory state first to avoid triggering hooks.

**Detection Risk:** Low

### 5. Polymorphic Delays

**Why:** EAC learns timing patterns.

**How:**
```rust
// Different delay each run
let variation = entropy % (base_ms / 2);
let actual_delay = base_ms + variation;
```

Timing changes every execution to avoid fingerprinting.

**Detection Risk:** Very Low

### 6. HWID Spoofing

**Why:** EAC bans hardware IDs (disk serial, MAC address, etc.).

**How:**
- Modify registry entries (disk serials)
- Change MAC address
- Spoof volume serials via kernel driver
- Clear EAC cache files

**Detection Risk:** Medium
- Incomplete spoof = instant ban
- Must spoof ALL hardware IDs
- Requires reboot

**Code:**
```rust
eac_bypass::hwid_spoof::full_spoof();
// Restart before playing
```

## What We DON'T Do (But Could)

### Advanced Techniques Not Implemented

1. **Vulnerable Driver Exploit**
   - Use known-vulnerable signed driver (CVE-2020-XXXX)
   - Load our driver via the vulnerable driver
   - Avoids needing our own driver signature
   - **Pro:** No signature needed
   - **Con:** Vulnerabilities get patched quickly

2. **DMA Hardware**
   - Physical PCIe card reads RAM directly
   - Cheat runs on second PC connected via Ethernet
   - Completely external to game PC
   - **Pro:** Nearly undetectable
   - **Con:** Costs $300-1000, needs second machine

3. **Hypervisor-Based**
   - Run Windows in a hypervisor
   - Cheat runs in hypervisor layer (below kernel)
   - Can hide from kernel-level EAC
   - **Pro:** Most secure method
   - **Con:** Extremely complex, performance impact

4. **Process Hollowing**
   - Inject into legitimate process (svchost, explorer)
   - Harder for EAC to identify cheat process
   - **Pro:** Blends in with system processes
   - **Con:** Still detectable via code scanning

## Detection Probability

| Technique | Detection Risk | Lifespan |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| User-mode memory R/W | **VERY HIGH** | Hours |
| Kernel driver (unsigned) | **HIGH** | Days |
| Kernel driver (signed) | **MEDIUM** | Weeks |
| Kernel driver (polymorphic) | **LOW** | Months |
| DMA hardware | **VERY LOW** | Years |
| Macro-based (mouse control) | **MINIMAL** | Indefinite |

## Why You'll Still Get Banned

Even with all these techniques, you can still get banned:

### 1. Behavioral Detection
- **100% headshot rate** = ban
- **Instant snap to head** = ban
- **Perfect recoil control** = ban
- **Seeing players through walls** = suspicious reports

EAC server-side AI analyzes statistics. If you're too good, you're flagged.

**Solution:** "Legit" cheating
- Miss some shots intentionally
- Add reaction time delay (200-300ms)
- Don't snap instantly to head
- Aim at body sometimes

### 2. Player Reports
- Other players spectate you
- Report suspicious behavior
- EAC reviews manually
- Ban

**Solution:** Don't be obvious.

### 3. Signature Updates
- EAC adds driver signature to blacklist
- Next update detects your driver
- Ban

**Solution:** Rebuild driver weekly with new signature.

### 4. HWID Tracking
- EAC tracks hardware IDs
- Incomplete HWID spoof = detected
- Ban is permanent (hardware)

**Solution:** Full HWID spoof before first use.

## Realistic Expectations

### With This Cheat (Basic)
- **No driver:** Banned within 1-3 hours
- **With driver:** Banned within 1-2 weeks
- **With driver + polymorphic:** 3-4 weeks
- **With driver + legit play:** 1-3 months

### With Premium Paid Cheats
- **Good private cheat:** 1-6 months
- **Top-tier cheat ($50-100/mo):** 6-12 months
- **DMA-based:** Rarely banned (but expensive)

## Best Practices

To maximize undetected time:

1. **Don't blatantly cheat**
   - Keep K/D reasonable (2-3, not 20+)
   - Miss shots sometimes
   - Don't snap to heads instantly

2. **Use alt account first**
   - Test on throwaway account
   - If banned, main account is safe

3. **Avoid official servers**
   - Community servers have less monitoring
   - Some disable EAC entirely

4. **Update regularly**
   - Game updates = offset changes
   - Driver signatures get blacklisted
   - Rebuild weekly

5. **HWID spoof BEFORE first ban**
   - Once banned, HWID is flagged
   - Spoofing after ban is harder

6. **Combine with macro-based**
   - Use kernel driver for ESP only
   - Use macro for no-recoil
   - Less memory writes = less detection

## Building Full EAC-Proof Cheat

If you want a truly undetected cheat:

1. **Get DMA card** ($300-1000)
   - Squirrel, PCILeech, or similar
   - Second PC required

2. **OR buy EV certificate** ($300-500/year)
   - Sign kernel driver properly
   - Rebuild weekly with polymorphism

3. **Implement legit bot**
   - Human-like aiming (smooth, misses)
   - Reaction time delays
   - Statistics within normal range

4. **Test extensively**
   - Run for days on alt account
   - Monitor for any detection
   - Only use on main when confident

## Legal Disclaimer

All of this violates:
- Rust Terms of Service
- Easy Anti-Cheat EULA
- Possibly CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)

**Consequences:**
- Permanent game ban
- Hardware ID ban
- Steam/account ban
- Possible legal action for distribution

Use for educational purposes ONLY. Don't cheat in online games.
